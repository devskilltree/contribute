## How do I start learning?

One idea, start with selecting a job that you like from job sites like:

- https://web3.career/
- https://cryptojobslist.com/
- https://www.womenwhocode.com/jobs?query=blockchain

Then identify the skills that you need to build for your dream job and set your learning goal.

If your learning goals are not already populated in the Dev Skill Tree, know that creating a learning path yourself is a way to learn, too.
